                        Charles John Huffam Dickens FRSA was an English writer and social critic. He created some of the
                        world's best-known fictional characters and is regarded by many as the greatest novelist of the
                        Victorian era.[1] His works enjoyed unprecedented popularity during his lifetime, and by the
                        20th century, critics and scholars had recognised him as a literary genius. His novels and short
                        stories are still widely read today.[2][3]

                        Born in Portsmouth, Dickens left school to work in a factory when his father was incarcerated in
                        a debtors' prison. Despite his lack of formal education, he edited a weekly journal for 20
                        years, wrote 15 novels, five novellas, hundreds of short stories and non-fiction articles,
                        lectured and performed readings extensively, was an indefatigable letter writer, and campaigned
                        vigorously for children's rights, education, and other social reforms.
